# Banking API

## Objective

Your assignment is to build an internal API for a fake financial institution using Node and no framework.
Brief

While modern banks have evolved to serve a plethora of functions, at their core, 
banks must provide certain basic features. Today, your task is to build the basic HTTP API for one of those banks! 
Imagine you are designing a backend API for bank employees. 
It could ultimately be consumed by multiple frontends (web, iOS, Android etc).

## Tasks
```
    Implement assignment using:
        Language: NodeJS / TypeScript
        Framework: any
    There should be API routes that allow them to:
        Create a new bank account for a customer, with an initial deposit amount. 
        A single customer may have multiple bank accounts.
        Transfer amounts between any two accounts, including those owned by different customers.
        Retrieve balances for a given account.
        Retrieve transfer history for a given account.
    Write tests for your business logic
```
Feel free to pre-populate your customers with the following:
```
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Arisha Barron"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Branden Gibson"
  },
  {
    "id": 3,
    "name": "Rhonda Church"
  },
  {
    "id": 4,
    "name": "Georgina Hazel"
  }
]
```
You are expected to design any other required models and routes for your API.

Evaluation Criteria:
```
    Node best practices
    Completeness: did you complete the features?
    Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
    Maintainability: is it written in a clean, maintainable way?
    Testing: is the system adequately tested?
    Documentation: is the API well-documented?
```

Please organize, design, test and document your code as if it were going into production - create a Git repo, push your code, then share it with us.

All the best and happy coding,
